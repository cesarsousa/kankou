BTextoIntroducao=<p class="letraNormal">In <span class="letraGrande">Traditional Chinese Medicine / Acupuncture</span> the <span class="letraGrande">examination of the tongue</span> is regarded as one of the vital steps towards an appropriate holistic diagnosis. For Traditional Chinese Medicine / Acupuncture, a normal tongue should show a light red or pinkish coloration, covered in a fine white coating. Alterations in this pattern indicate disharmony in the body.</p><p class="letraNormal"><span class="letraGrande">Mouth cancer</span> is considered to be the 12th commonest malignancy in the world. Statistically speaking, approximately half of the cases are detected at advanced stages, and only 50% of the diagnosed patients will survive over a period of five years.</p><p class="letraNormal">It is also known that <span class="letraGrande">early detection</span> of oral lesions is more likely to occur if seen by a dentist, because checking the mouth is commonplace in daily clinical dental practice.</p><p class="letraNormal">The detection of those lesions in the mouth that carry a potential to become cancerous is a matter of<span class="letraGrande"> an unmissed opportunity</span>, most of the time!</p><p class="letraNormal">Dentists are the health professionals that most detect mouth cancer due to their routine access to the oral cavity. Another health professional, <span class="letraGrande">the acupuncturist</span>, can also be trained to perform the opportunistic detection of oral lesions, as they also routinely check the mouth to inspect the tongue.</p><p class="letraNormal">Going beyond the inspection of the tongue and learning <span class="letraGrande"> to examine the whole mouth</span>, you, the acupuncturist could and should act in the <span class="letraGrande">early detection</span> of oral lesions, which can become cancerous lesions and, ultimately, <span class="letraGrande">save lives</span>!</p>

BTextoExame=<p class="letraNormal"><span class="letraGrande">The inspection of the mouth is quick and painless!</span></p>
BTextoExame1=<p class="letraNormal">Examine the patient under <span class="letraGrande">appropriate lighting</span>. If your patient wears removable prostheses (partial or full dentures), ask him/her to remove them before the examination. Have at hand <span class="letraGrande">disposable spatulas</span> to move away the lips and the cheeks and gauze swabs to pull the tongue, if necessary.</p><p class="letraNormal">All <span class="letraGrande">patients</span> must be examined, but special attention must be given to those considered to be <span class="letraGrande">at high risk</span>, such as <span class="letraGrande">smokers</span> of any kind of substance or those who chew tobacco, individuals <span class="letraGrande">over 40</span>, alcohol users, those with poor oral hygiene, <span class="letraGrande">undernourished</span>, and <span class="letraGrande">immunosuppressed</span>.</p>
BTextoExame2=<p class="letraNormal">We strongly recommend special attention <span class="letraGrande">to white, red or pigmented lesions</span>; Injuries that bleed and do not heal. Difficulty swallowing and chronic hoarseness are also alarming symptoms, as some tumors are located in the throat region and are not visible on a simple clinical examination.</p>
