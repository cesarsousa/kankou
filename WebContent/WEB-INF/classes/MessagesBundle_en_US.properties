BTextoIntroducao=<p class="letraNormal">In <span class="letraGrande">Traditional Chinese Medicine / Acupuncture</span> the <span class="letraGrande">examination of the tongue</span> is recommended as one of the steps for the achievement of the diagnosis relevant to this knowledge. For Traditional Chinese Medicine / Acupuncture a normal tongue presents light red or pinkish coloration, covered in fine and white saburra. Alterations in this pattern indicate disharmony in the body.</p><p class="letraNormal"><span class="letraGrande">Mouth cancer</span> is considered to be the 12th most common malignant tumor in the world. Statistically speaking, almost half of the cases are detected in advanced stages, prospecting that 50% of diagnosed patients have a survival of only five years on average.</p><p class="letraNormal">It is also known that <span class="letraGrande">early detection</span> of oral lesions is more common among dentists, because checking the mouth is routine in their clinical practice. The detection of lesions in the mouth that can even be pre-cancerous is a matter of <span class="letraGrande">opportunity</span> most of times.</p><p class="letraNormal">So, realizing that because of routinely access to oral cavity, the dentist is on the top of professionals who most detect mouth cancer, another health professional, <span class="letraGrande">the acupuncturist</span>, can also be trained to perform the opportunistic detection of oral lesions as they also routinely checks the mouth to inspect the tongue.</p><p class="letraNormal">Going beyond the inspection of the tongue and <span class="letraGrande">learning</span> to examine the whole mouth, you, the acupuncturist could and should act in the <span class="letraGrande">early detection</span> of oral injuries, which can be pre- cancerous lesions and eventually <span class="letraGrande">save lives</span>.</p>

BTextoExame=<p class="letraNormal"><span class="letraGrande">The inspection of the mouth is quick and painless!</span></p>
BTextoExame1=<p class="letraNormal">Examine the patient under <span class="letraGrande">appropriate lighting</span>. If your patient wears removable prosthesis (partial or full dentures), ask him/her to remove it before the examination. Have at hand, <span class="letraGrande">disposable spatulas</span> to away lips and cheeks mucosa, and lint to pull the tongue if necessary.</p><p class="letraNormal">All <span class="letraGrande">patients</span> must be examined, but special attention must be given to those considered <span class="letraGrande">under risk</span>, <span class="letraGrande">smokers</span> of any kind of substance or those who chew tobacco, individuals <span class="letraGrande">over 40</span>, alcohol users, those with poor oral hygiene, <span class="letraGrande">undernourished and immunosuppressed</span>.</p><p class="letraNormal"><span class="letraGrande">Check lips, gums, cheeks mucosa, tongue, hard and soft palate, throat and neck</span>.</p>
BTextoExame2=<p class="letraNormal"><span class="letraGrande">What to look for? \u2013 We strongly recommend special attention to white lesions, red lesions or pigmented ones; Injuries that do not heal and bleed</span>. Difficulties to swallow and chronic hoarseness are also symptom alerts, as some tumors are in the throat region and are not visible to a simple clinical examination.</p>
